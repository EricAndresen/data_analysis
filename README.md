# Data Analysis Projects
This is a collection of small projects to learn exploratory analysis, visualization, wrangling, and hypthothesis testing.
Several of these project were a part of my [Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002). If any code was provided to me, it is commented in the code.
